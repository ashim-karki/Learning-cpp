Divide and conquer algorithm. The array is divided (e.g. by recursion) and merged together in sorted order. It is NOT an in-place sorting algorithm i.e. it does not take constant amount of extra memory but can be made one.

"QuickSort is an Optimal Sorting algorithm which can be used on arrays as well as on linked lists with little modification. In Arrays,it is an In-place sorting algorithm , it uses constant space and its Time complexity is O(NlogN) , where N is the number of nodes in the list.

On LinkedLists , QuickSort can be very efficient but the probability of hitting the worst case scenario will also increase because it uses a predefined pivot.Randomization can help mitigate this issue but will incur a penalty which increases runtime , that's why MergeSort is preferred in LinkedLists because it will guarantee a worst case runtime of O(NlogN) and also the space complexity of MergeSort is constant for LinkedLists."
