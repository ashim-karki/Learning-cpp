Divide and conquer algorithm. This is an in-place algorithm as no auxiliary arrays are created as in merge sort.

"QuickSort is an Optimal Sorting algorithm which can be used on arrays as well as on linked lists with little modification. In Arrays,it is an In-place sorting algorithm , it uses constant space and its Time complexity is O(NlogN) , where N is the number of nodes in the list.

On LinkedLists , QuickSort can be very efficient but the probability of hitting the worst case scenario will also increase because it uses a predefined pivot.Randomization can help mitigate this issue but will incur a penalty which increases runtime , that's why MergeSort is preferred in LinkedLists because it will guarantee a worst case runtime of O(NlogN) and also the space complexity of MergeSort is constant for LinkedLists."
